    <h1>Hamburger</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Hamburgers were discovered in 1609 by the intrepid explorers Juan Gaejote and Brimsward Fugginwild, out in the wilderness of Brekinshire, London. In their primitive form, what is now known simply as "a burger" hardly bears a resemblance to modern interpretations of the dish.<br>In any case, hamburgers are simply composed of at minimum, the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <ul>2x bun</ul>
        <ul>1-4x patty</ul>
        <ul>1-2x cheese (optional)</ul>
    </ol>
